# Scripts
This repository contains the scripts used for analysis of single cell RNA seq data for "Transcriptional specification of fetal to adult liver  vascular functional zonation" [[add link/doi]], including: i) Seurat base analysis of single cell RNA seq data for developmental timepoints; ii) RNA velocity analysis using velocyto [[ref-link]] and scVelo [[ref-link]] for developmental timepoints to infer transitions and genes driving the transcriptional changes and iii) RNA velocity analysis for either WT and Maf knockout mice, for comparison of developmental trajectories of endothelial cells upon Maf knockout.

In addition, we provide the processed loom files and the Seurat object to facilitate downstream analysis without the need to re-process the raw data (available in GEO).
